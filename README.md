Source code for my personal website, built with [Hugo.](https://gohugo.io/)

## TODO
- Create templates for different types of posts (categories: journal entries, project documentation, music, image galleries, more?)
- Cooler design
- Better auto-thumbnail generation
- Auto-make twitter/facebook cards for easy sharing to social media
- Search functionality
