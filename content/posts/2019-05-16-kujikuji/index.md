This whale pillow, officially known as Kanaloa, but affectionately known as **Kujikuji**, is perhaps the greatest pillow ever created. The design is simple, elegant, and extremely cute. Its round, puffy shape makes it the ideal cuddling companion. I cannot over-emphasize how impressed I am by the design of this deceptively simple toy. The curves are so satisying, and every detail is perfect and cute: the tiny flippers, the perky tail, the sleeping eyes.

So many stuffed animals fall short on cuteness. I know cuteness is extremely subjective, but there is a large divide between a masterpiece like Kujikuji and a mediocre teddy bear like this:

While I concede that some people would find the above bear cute, and it is moderately so, I find its design sorely lacking. So what's wrong with this bear, and what makes it so inferior to Kujikuji? Here are some of my theories:

- The raised eyebrows. Cute eyebrows are difficult to manage. No eyebrows are usually a safer bet.
- The smile. Stuffed animals are usually cuter without mouths, or with an  inverted Y mouth.
- The bloody red paw.
- The swirly eyes. Button eyes, black marble eyes, or simple lines are cuter.
- The lanky shape. The cutest stuffed animals are rotund, often to the point of absurdity.

I believe the underlying theme to all these criticisms is: **the simpler, the cuter.** However, this is just one theory to explain what I deeply feel in my gut. The widely accepted theory of cuteness is that juvenile features associated with babies are cute: large eyes, large heads, small chins, etc. However, I have encountered a variety of stuffed animals which run counter to these features, with strange shapes, small eyes, etc. And yet they are undeniably cute. I believe more careful study and analysis is warranted, in order to develop a complete and rigid theory of cuteness. More on this subject later.
