This whale pillow, officially known as **Kanaloa**, is a paragon of good design. It is simple, elegant, and extremely cute. Its puffiness is great for both cuddling and use as a pillow, the curves are satisfying to the eye, and every small detail is simple but cute: tiny flippers, perky tail, peacefully sleeping eyes.

Many stuffed animals, especially in the western world, fall short on cuteness. Cuteness is extremely subjective, but there is an objectively large divide between an elegant masterpiece like Kanaloa and a mediocre teddy bear like this:

I concede that this bear is moderately cute. However, I find its design lacking in comparison to Kanaloa. This opinion is mainly based on my gut instinct, but here are some observations off the top of my head about what's wrong with this bear:

- The raised eyebrows. It would have been cuter without them. The simpler, the better.
- The eyes are too cartoonish. Button eyes, black marble eyes, or simple lines are cuter.
- The unnatural smile. Stuffed animals are almost always cuter with an inverted Y mouth, or no mouth at all.
- The bloody red paw. Why?
- The lanky shape. The cutest stuffed animals are rotund, often to the point of absurdity.

The common theme of all these criticisms is basically **the simpler, the cuter.**

The widely accepted theory of cuteness is that juvenile features associated with babies are cute: large eyes, large heads, small chins, and so on. However, I have encountered many exceptions to this rule. Large eyes can be especially off-putting:

This cat's monstrous eyes border on unsettling. And other stuffed animals break all the rules, with strange shapes, small eyes, and giant chins...and yet they are undeniably cute:

I believe there is more to cuteness than the youthfulness of individual features. One must also consider simplicity, elegance, and quirkiness. I look forward to encountering and creating many strange and cute creatures in the future!
