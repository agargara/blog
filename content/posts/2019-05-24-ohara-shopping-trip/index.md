I recently bought a used 50cc scooter, a Suzuki Let's 4 Pallet.

I hadn't taken it for a joyride yet, so today I rode to nearby Ohara (大原). Ohara is a small, rural village in northern Kyoto that is best known for the temple complex Sanzenin (三千院). Ohara mostly looks something like this:

Ohara is also home to [Shino (志野)](http://www.sino.co.jp/index.htm) which makes very delicious yuzu ponzu (ゆずポン酢) among other sauces and dressings. Yuzu is a kind of citrus, and ponzu is a tangy citrus based sauce, somewhere in between soy sauce and a vinaigrette. My wife requested me to buy a bottle of ponzu, as we were running out, and I was glad to have a mission for my trip.

The weather was perfect, very sunny but not swelteringly hot in the wind. Navigating the slightly mountainous roads and curves was fun, although not as challenging as I had expected.

The speed limit for 50cc bikes is technically 30kph, but I usually stayed around a comfortable 40kph. The fastest my scooter was able to go was just above 60kph downhill, which is actually above the limit of the speedometer!

I'd already been to Sanzenin, and felt no need to go again. Instead, I took a random small road into the mountains. I encountered an old man also on a 50cc, who I followed into the forest.

However, I soon had to turn back because I was worried about fuel, which had dropped below 1/4 remaining.

On the way back I stopped at Takaragaike park, which was pleasant as always.

On the way home I dropped by Mister Donuts, to buy my wife a matcha old-fashioned donut, honey dip for myself, and two pon-de-kokuto (black sugar) as usual. I would have taken a picture but we already ate them. A successful shopping trip indeed.
