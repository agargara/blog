> "	The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
And his affections dark as Erebus.
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music."
ãƒ¼ Lorenzo, *The Merchant of Venice* (William Shakespeare)
