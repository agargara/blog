## Quotes found in *Thank You, Jeeves* by P.G. Wodehouse

> The man that hath no music in himself,  
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,  
Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.  
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,  
And his affections dark as Erebus.  
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.  
ー Lorenzo, *The Merchant of Venice* (William Shakespeare)

> A blank, my lord. She never told her love,  
But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,  
Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,  
And with a green and yellow melancholy  
She sat like patience on a monument,  
Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?  
We men may say more, swear more, but indeed  
Our shows are more than will, for still we prove  
Much in our vows, but little in our love.  
ー Viola, *Twelfth Night* (William Shakespeare)

> But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon lover!
ー Samuel Taylor Coleridge, *Kubla Khan*

> Howe’er it be, it seems to me,  
  ’Tis only noble to be good.  
Kind hearts are more than coronets,  
  And simple faith than Norman blood.  
ー Lord Alfred Tennyson, *Lady Clara Vere de Vere*

> Others abide our question. Thou art free.  
ー Matthew Arnold, *Shakespeare*

> The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,  
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit  
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,  
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.  
ー Omar Khayyám, *Rubáiyát* (translation by Edward FitzGerald)
