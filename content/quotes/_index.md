## Quotes found in *Thank You, Jeeves* by P.G. Wodehouse

> The man that hath no music in himself,  
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,  
Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.  
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,  
And his affections dark as Erebus.  
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.  
ー Lorenzo, *The Merchant of Venice* (William Shakespeare)

> A blank, my lord. She never told her love,  
But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,  
Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,  
And with a green and yellow melancholy  
She sat like patience on a monument,  
Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?  
We men may say more, swear more, but indeed  
Our shows are more than will, for still we prove  
Much in our vows, but little in our love.  
ー Viola, *Twelfth Night* (William Shakespeare)

> But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon lover!
ー Samuel Taylor Coleridge, *Kubla Khan*

> Howe’er it be, it seems to me,  
  ’Tis only noble to be good.  
Kind hearts are more than coronets,  
  And simple faith than Norman blood.  
ー Lord Alfred Tennyson, *Lady Clara Vere de Vere*

> Others abide our question. Thou art free.  
ー Matthew Arnold, *Shakespeare*

> The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,  
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit  
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,  
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.  
ー Omar Khayyám, *Rubáiyát* (translation by Edward FitzGerald)

> Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And saw, within the moonlight in his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An angel writing in a book of gold:—
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And to the presence in the room he said,
"What writest thou?"—The vision raised its head,
And with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered, "The names of those who love the Lord."
"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still; and said, "I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow men."
The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night
It came again with a great wakening light,
And showed the names whom love of God had blest,
And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.
ー Leigh Hunt, *Abou Ben Adhem*
