<p>This whale pillow, officially known as Kanaloa, but affectionately known as <strong>Kujikuji</strong>, is perhaps the greatest pillow ever created. The design is simple, elegant, and extremely cute. Its round, puffy shape makes it the ideal cuddling companion. I cannot over-emphasize how impressed I am by the design of this deceptively simple toy. The curves are so satisying, and every detail is perfect and cute: the tiny flippers, the perky tail, the sleeping eyes.</p>

<p>So many stuffed animals fall short on cuteness. I know cuteness is extremely subjective, but there is a large divide between a masterpiece like Kujikuji and a mediocre teddy bear like this:</p>

<p>While I concede that some people would find the above bear cute, and it is moderately so, I find its design sorely lacking. So what&rsquo;s wrong with this bear, and what makes it so inferior to Kujikuji? Here are some of my theories:</p>

<ul>
<li>The raised eyebrows. Cute eyebrows are difficult to manage. No eyebrows are usually a safer bet.</li>
<li>The smile. Stuffed animals are usually cuter without mouths, or with an  inverted Y mouth.</li>
<li>The bloody red paw.</li>
<li>The swirly eyes. Button eyes, black marble eyes, or simple lines are cuter.</li>
<li>The lanky shape. The cutest stuffed animals are rotund, often to the point of absurdity.</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe the underlying theme to all these criticisms is: <strong>the simpler, the cuter.</strong> However, this is just one theory to explain what I deeply feel in my gut. The widely accepted theory of cuteness is that juvenile features associated with babies are cute: large eyes, large heads, small chins, etc. However, I have encountered a variety of stuffed animals which run counter to these features, with strange shapes, small eyes, etc. And yet they are undeniably cute. I believe more careful study and analysis is warranted, in order to develop a complete and rigid theory of cuteness. More on this subject later.</p>
